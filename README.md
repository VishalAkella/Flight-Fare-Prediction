# Flight-Fare-Prediction

Flight ticket prices are something that can be hard to guess. The prices can be too dynamic and are often unpredictable. So we will try to use Machine Learning to solve this problem which can help airlines in predicting what prices they can maintain and also the customers in predicting the future flight prices and plan their journey accordingly.

In this project, we will be using essential exploratory data analysis techniques for analyzing the dataset which helps us draw some insights about the price of the flight based on the features and develop a predictive Machine learning model to predict the future pricing of the flights.
